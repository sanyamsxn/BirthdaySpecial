                    I guess that i should this with a huge HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
                </p>
                <p>Its hard to put into words what you means to me, you are my favourite human being that ever existed.
                   I like you for so many reasons, you are emotional, hilarious, sweet, you work at friendship with so much
                   care and put so much efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are the closest friend I have. You are that one person with whom i can sit and talk to for the longest
                    time. With you I can just be me. I can speak what i think, without using a filter. And this is so because 
                    you are a wonderful person at heart. You are truly an amazing soul. Thanks for being there when I needed a
                    shoulder to lean on, for patiently listening to my personal talks.
                </p>
                <p> I really enjoy this relationship with no fake promises, just being career oriented and sharing so many things with
                    each other. I feel blessed that I get to call you my best friend. I am seriously glad that you were born, and I can't wait
                    to see what our future holds. Let us gear up to explore more years together.
                </p>
